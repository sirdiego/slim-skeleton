# Slim framework skeleton

This is my little slim skeleton to make it easier to start a new slim application.

## Installation

1. Start the new application

    composer.phar create-project diego/slim-skeleton Application

2. Now copy `config/config.example.php` to `config/config.php` and change it to your needs
3. Point your document root to the `web/` directory

## Directories

* `web/` is used as the document root
* `templates/` used for template files
* `src/` for the application classes
* `config/` for configuration files
